MATRIX CALCULATORSA
Authored by Adam Sharabati
 
 ==Description==
	In this file you will find three programs that simulate a matrix calculator... The calculators can handle 4 matrix dataType (int, double, int complex, binnary)
	1-	the first program resives two matrixes and an opperator that you want to calculate (ADD,SUB,MUL,AND,OR,NOT,TRANSPOSE)
		for the opperators NOT, TRANSPOSE you must enter only one matrix.
		the opperators AND, OR are only for binarry matrixes, and the code prints "ERR" if you entered a non binarry number in the matrix.
	2-	the second program is devided to two programs that use shared memmory consept.. the first program enters matrixes and opperators as data to the shared memmory
		when you run the second program it reads the data that the first program saved in the shared memory and prints the output then delete the shared memory.
	3-	the theird program is a complicated virsuin of the first one. the user enter an even number of matrixes an an opperator that want to make between them.
		the program calculates the result and print it using threads.
		opperators that the third program can handle(ADD,MUL,AND,OR).
	
 
 ==Key Features==
